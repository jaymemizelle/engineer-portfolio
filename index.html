                <p>I am a full stack web developer leveraging a background in healthcare, which has provided me with a number of transferable skills such as great attention to detail, documentation of sensitive and private information, adaptability, flexibility, and patience. Problem solving is my passion, and learning is my obsession, which makes software development the perfect field for me. With skills in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, balance, design, and functionality are my focus. Intrigued and curious about computer science, I began as a self-taught programmer, and I am known for how quickly I pick up new technologies. I am continuing my education with the University of Oregon in order to expand my technical skill set to include  jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Git, and MySQL. I'm excited to bring my passionate and positive attitude into a face-paced team of engineers that will allow me to learn by meeting challenges head-on, and collaborating with my colleagues to create solutions  built from innovative perspectives. In my spare time I can be found hiking, teaching myself guitar, or reading. I am passionate about bringing an innovative perspective into the web development arena that is more geared toward expanding the user's choice and control over the technologies they interact with. </p>
